# Apple M1 Setup for Machine Learning
---
Switching from Intel CPU Macbook to M1 Macbook has been a journey for the last couple of years. My most complain goes to the missing GPU support. Otherwise, pip can install most packages successfully. In a couple of failure cases, I could always find alternative package, or just go back to the old 2015 Intel Mac, so there has not been much headache. Amazing that old MAC is still doing fine. 10 bonus points to Apple!
